RO2 — Multi Point-Cloud Viewer
________________________________________

Description

RO2 provides an XR interface for evaluating static 3D stone models encoded using three point-cloud compression codecs:

V-PCC

G-PCC Octree

G-PCC Trisoup

Each compressed model is shown next to the original full-resolution version at three different viewing distances.
The application is designed to run on Quest 3, PICO 4 / Ultra, and Vision Pro through ALVR PC-VR streaming, ensuring identical visual conditions across all devices.

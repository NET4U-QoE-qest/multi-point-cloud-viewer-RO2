Description
RO2 provides an XR interface for evaluating static 3D stone models encoded with three point-cloud compression codecs:
•	V-PCC
•	G-PCC Octree
•	G-PCC Trisoup
Each compressed model is shown beside the original full-resolution version across three viewing distances.
The experiment runs on Quest 3, PICO 4/Ultra, and Vision Pro via ALVR PC VR streaming, ensuring identical visual conditions on all devices.

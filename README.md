RO2 — multi-point-cloud-viewer
Description

RO2 provides an XR interface for evaluating static 3D stone models encoded with three point-cloud compression codecs:

V-PCC

G-PCC Octree

G-PCC Trisoup

Each compressed model is displayed beside the original full-resolution version across three viewing distances.
The experiment runs on Quest 3, PICO 4 / Ultra, and Vision Pro via ALVR PC VR streaming, ensuring identical visual conditions on all devices.

Features

Original vs. compressed side-by-side comparison

Two included scenes:

RO2_Windows_PicoQuest – controller-based interaction

RO2_Windows_VisionPro – gaze + pinch interaction

Full compatibility with ALVR across all supported headsets
